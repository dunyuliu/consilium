# Consilium

Personal Claude Code customizations: slash commands and subagents that follow
you across machines.

## Install on a new machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dunyuliu/consilium.git ~/consilium
bash ~/consilium/scripts/install.sh
```

`install.sh` creates symlinks from `~/.claude/{commands,agents}/<name>` to
files inside this repo, so editing a file here immediately reflects in Claude
Code, and `git pull` updates them.

## Three teams

Consilium organises around three editorial-style teams plus one solo
refactorer. Each team has a single front door so you never have to remember
the specialist roster.

### Editorial — under `elena-hartmann`

Scientific judgment on a manuscript, analysis, or claim. Elena gives the
verdict and dispatches the deep-domain critical reviewers directly. For any
technical work (code, data, physics, math, spec drift), she hands the whole
bundle to `victor-reyes` rather than re-implementing his routing table.

| Member | Role |
|---|---|
| `elena-hartmann` | Editor in Chief. Holistic verdict. The buck stops here. |
| `ziyan-chen` | Citations, DOIs, author lists, claim-vs-abstract. |
| `selin-aydin` | Critical reviewer — seismology, earthquake-rupture physics, ground motion. |
| `marco-bianchi` | Critical reviewer — geodynamics, geodesy, long-timescale Earth physics. |

### Audit — under `victor-reyes`

Technical depth on what's actually in the repo: bugs, drift, integrity,
correctness. Victor diagnoses scope and spawns the right specialist(s) in
parallel.

| Member | Role |
|---|---|
| `victor-reyes` | Audit orchestrator. Routes technical work, runs specialists in parallel, aggregates findings. |
| `lars-eriksson` | Code auditor — math errors, edge cases, sign conventions, silent failures. |
| `priya-nair` | Numeric-claim verifier — re-derives from raw anchor data. |
| `jordan-kim` | Data integrity — extraction quality and end-to-end pipeline tracing. |
| `sophia-okafor` | Spec drift — docs / methods / config vs actual code. |
| `rafael-santos` | Physical validity — units, conservation, boundary conditions. |
| `ingrid-lindqvist` | Mathematical rigor — derivations, stability, theorem applicability. |

### Release & publication

Two engineers for two different shipping problems: ongoing version releases
versus one-shot publication staging.

| Member | Role |
|---|---|
| `haruto-nakamura` | Release & maintenance engineer. Cuts versioned releases, keeps CI green, audits build reproducibility, manages dependency hygiene. |
| `anya-petrov` | Publication-staging engineer. Prepares a project for GitHub public release and a Zenodo data deposit — scrub, reproducibility floor, CITATION.cff, DOI. |

### Standalone

| Member | Role |
|---|---|
| `kai-fischer` | Refactoring engineer. Simplifies, dedupes, improves naming. Applies edits. Use after a `lars-eriksson` audit, not before. |

## Start here

| What you need | Front door |
|---|---|
| Science — manuscript, methodology, "is this sound?" | `elena-hartmann` (or `/review`) |
| Code, data, audits — "find what's wrong" | `victor-reyes` (or `/audit`) |
| Refactor working code | `kai-fischer` (or `/refactor`) |
| Cut a release / fix CI / keep the project shippable | `haruto-nakamura` (or `/release`) |
| Stage for public release — GitHub + Zenodo | `anya-petrov` (or `/stage-publish`) |

You rarely need to name a specialist directly. The front-door agent routes.

## Models

The team uses a mix of model sizes by role. Heaviest reasoning (orchestration,
final verdicts, adversarial reviewing) runs on opus; deep-but-specific work
runs on sonnet; pattern-match-heavy auditing runs on haiku.

| Model | Agents |
|---|---|
| opus | `elena-hartmann`, `victor-reyes`, `selin-aydin`, `marco-bianchi` |
| sonnet | `ziyan-chen`, `priya-nair`, `jordan-kim`, `rafael-santos`, `ingrid-lindqvist`, `kai-fischer`, `haruto-nakamura`, `anya-petrov` |
| haiku | `lars-eriksson`, `sophia-okafor` |

## How it works

- **Independence.** Each subagent runs in its own context and doesn't see
  your prior conversation. This forces re-derivation from raw sources.
- **Read-only specialists.** Auditors and reviewers verify; they don't fix.
  Apply fixes, then re-run to confirm. `kai-fischer` and `anya-petrov` are
  the exceptions — they apply edits within their scope.
- **Clear boundaries.** Each agent states what falls outside their scope
  and who to hand off to.
- **One routing table.** Victor owns the technical routing; Elena delegates
  technical work to him rather than maintaining a parallel table.
- **Final sign-off rests with the human.**

## Commands (slash)

| Slash | Agent | What |
|---|---|---|
| `/audit` | `victor-reyes` | Eight-section project audit. Writes `AUDIT.md`. |
| `/audit-citations` | `ziyan-chen` | Manuscript citations — DOIs, authors, claim-vs-abstract. |
| `/audit-claim` | `priya-nair` | Verify a specific numeric claim against raw anchor data. |
| `/audit-code` | `lars-eriksson` | Source-file bug hunt — math, edge cases, sign conventions. |
| `/audit-data` | `jordan-kim` | Data integrity — extraction and pipeline. |
| `/audit-math` | `ingrid-lindqvist` | Mathematical rigor — derivations, stability, theorems. |
| `/audit-physics` | `rafael-santos` | Physical validity — units, conservation, BCs. |
| `/audit-spec` | `sophia-okafor` | Spec drift — docs / config vs code. |
| `/refactor` | `kai-fischer` | Simplify, dedupe, improve naming. Applies edits. |
| `/release` | `haruto-nakamura` | Versioned-release workflow. `release` / `release minor` / `release major`. |
| `/review` | `elena-hartmann` | Full editorial decision — verdict, core weakness, Reviewer-2 attack. |
| `/stage-publish` | `anya-petrov` | Stage for GitHub + Zenodo publication. |

## Adding a new agent

1. Drop `agents/<name>.md` with frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`.
2. Write a specific `description:` — Victor and Elena route based on it.
3. Run `bash scripts/install.sh`.
4. Verify: open Claude Code and run `/agents`.

## Adding a new command

1. Drop `commands/<name>.md` (use existing files as templates).
2. Run `bash scripts/install.sh`.

## Regression evals

`evals/` holds small fixtures (planted bugs, stale docs, miscited papers) with
expected findings, so prompt changes can be measured rather than vibe-checked.
See `evals/README.md` for the fixture format and how to run a case.

## Roadmap

- Expand `evals/` coverage across every specialist (currently `lars-001`, `sophia-001`).
- Statistics specialist for p-hacking, multiple comparisons, study design.
- Security/privacy agent for credential leaks, PII, supply-chain risk.
- GitHub-Action wiring so audits run automatically on PRs.
